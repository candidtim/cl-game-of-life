# Conway's Game of Life in Common Lisp

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Common Lisp, mostly for fun and
to have something to practice the Lisp skills on.

At the moment not packaged in any way. To run it, load the `life.lisp` and
execute the `(play height width tick-duration)` function. Modify the `play`
function implementation to inject different figures at start.
